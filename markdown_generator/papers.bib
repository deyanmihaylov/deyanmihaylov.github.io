    abstract = {Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit Λ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., |ΩK|≪1. However, whether the geometry is flat (E3), positively curved (S3) or negatively curved (H3), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of S3 geometry, the lens spaces L(p,q), where p and q (p>1 and 0<q<p) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of S3 (the three-sphere) by ℤp, the cyclic group of order p. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on p and q as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of p and q. The smaller the value of |ΩK|, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of p. For example, if |ΩK|≃0.05 then p≤9, while if |ΩK|≃0.02, p can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of S3 topologies.},

    abstract = {The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-ℓ and odd-ℓ angular power spectrum Cℓ, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-ℓ EB correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example EB correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.},

    abstract = {Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe may give rise to potentially measurable signatures in the cosmic microwave background. We explore different machine learning approaches to classify harmonic-space realizations of the microwave background in the test case of Euclidean E1 topology (the 3-torus) with a cubic fundamental domain of a size scale significantly smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface. This is the first step toward developing a machine learning approach to classification of cosmic topology and likelihood-free inference of topological parameters. Different machine learning approaches are capable of classifying the harmonic-space realizations with accuracy greater than 99% if the topology scale is half of the diameter of the last-scattering surface and orientation of the topology is known. For distinguishing random rotations of these sky realizations from realizations of the covering space, the extreme gradient boosting classifier algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 88%. Slightly lower accuracies of 83% to 87% are obtained with the random forest classifier along with one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. The techniques presented here can also accurately classify non-rotated cubic E1 topology realizations with a topology scale slightly larger than the diameter of the last-scattering surface, if enough training data are provided. While information compressing methods like most machine learning approaches cannot exceed the statistical power of a likelihood-based approach that captures all available information, they potentially offer a computationally cheaper alternative. A principle challenge appears to be accounting for arbitrary orientations of a given topology, although this is also a significant hurdle for likelihood-based approaches.},

Here, we present observational results for a waveform-independent search sensitive to eccentric black hole coalescences, covering the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors.

    abstract = {If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies E1−E6, E11, E12, E16, and E18 that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.},

None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing.

It includes the full 4PN precessing-spin information, and is valid for generic compact objects (i.e., for black holes or neutron stars).

Efficiently and accurately modeling the GW signals emitted by these systems is crucial to extract their properties. Here, we present SEOBNRv5PHM, a multipolar precessing-spin waveform model within the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism for the full signal (i.e. inspiral, merger and ringdown) of binary black holes (BBHs). In the non-precessing limit, the model reduces to SEOBNRv5HM, which is calibrated to 442 numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, 13 waveforms from BH perturbation theory, and non-spinning energy flux from second-order gravitational self-force theory. We remark that SEOBNRv5PHM is not calibrated to precessing-spin NR waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration. We validate SEOBNRv5PHM by computing the unfaithfulness against 1543 precessing-spin NR waveforms, and find that for 99.8% (84.4%) of the cases, the maximum value, in the total mass range 20-300 M⊙, is below 3% (1%).

Due to much better computational efficiency of SEOBNRv5PHM compared to SEOBNRv4PHM, we are also able to perform extensive Bayesian parameter estimation on synthetic signals and GW events observed by LIGO-Virgo detectors.

The PBH model uses recent prescriptions for the merger rate of PBH binaries that include a rate suppression factor to effectively account for PBH early binary disruptions. If the PBHs are monochromatically distributed, we can exclude a dark matter fraction in PBHs fPBH≳0.6 (at 90% confidence) in the probed subsolar-mass range. However, if we allow for broad PBH mass distributions we are unable to rule out fPBH=1. For the dissipative model, where the dark matter has chemistry that allows a small fraction to cool and collapse into black holes, we find an upper bound fDBH<10−5 on the fraction of atomic dark matter collapsed into black holes.},

    abstract = {Gravitational waves are expected to be produced from neutron star oscillations associated with magnetar giant flares and short bursts. We present the results of a search for short-duration (milliseconds to seconds) and long-duration (∼100 s) transient gravitational waves from 13 magnetar short bursts observed during Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA's third observation run. These 13 bursts come from two magnetars, SGR 1935+2154 and Swift J1818.0−1607. We also include three other electromagnetic burst events detected by Fermi GBM which were identified as likely coming from one or more magnetars, but they have no association with a known magnetar. No magnetar giant flares were detected during the analysis period. We find no evidence of gravitational waves associated with any of these 16 bursts. We place upper bounds on the root-sum-square of the integrated gravitational-wave strain that reach 2.2×10−23 /Hz‾‾‾√ at 100 Hz for the short-duration search and 8.7×10−23 /Hz‾‾‾√ at 450 Hz for the long-duration search, given a detection efficiency of 50%. For a ringdown signal at 1590 Hz targeted by the short-duration search the limit is set to 1.8×10−22 /Hz‾‾‾√. Using the estimated distance to each magnetar, we derive upper bounds on the emitted gravitational-wave energy of 3.2×1043 erg (7.3×1043 erg) for SGR 1935+2154 and 8.2×1042 erg (2.8×1043 erg) for Swift J1818.0−1607, for the short-duration (long-duration) search. Assuming isotropic emission of electromagnetic radiation of the burst fluences, we constrain the ratio of gravitational-wave energy to electromagnetic energy for bursts from SGR 1935+2154 with available fluence information. The lowest of these ratios is 3×103.},

This is a semicoherent search which uses details of the signal model to coherently combine data separated by less than a specified coherence time, which can be adjusted to balance sensitivity with computing cost. The search covered a range of gravitational-wave frequencies from 25Hz to 1600Hz, as well as ranges in orbital speed, frequency and phase determined from observational constraints. No significant detection candidates were found, and upper limits were set as a function of frequency. The most stringent limits, between 100Hz and 200Hz, correspond to an amplitude h0 of about 1e-25 when marginalized isotropically over the unknown inclination angle of the neutron star's rotation axis, or less than 4e-26 assuming the optimal orientation. The sensitivity of this search is now probing amplitudes predicted by models of torque balance equilibrium. For the usual conservative model assuming accretion at the surface of the neutron star, our isotropically-marginalized upper limits are close to the predicted amplitude from about 70Hz to 100Hz; the limits assuming the neutron star spin is aligned with the most likely orbital angular momentum are below the conservative torque balance predictions from 40Hz to 200Hz. Assuming a broader range of accretion models, our direct limits on gravitational-wave amplitude delve into the relevant parameter space over a wide range of frequencies, to 500Hz or more.},

We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates ≤10−3 yr−1≤10 −3 yr−1. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to mg≤1.27×10−23eV/c2m g​ ≤1.27×10 −23 eV/c2. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints.

Each gravitational wave (GW) signal provides the luminosity distance to the source, and we estimate the corresponding redshift using two methods: the redshifted masses and a galaxy catalog. Using the binary black hole (BBH) redshifted masses, we simultaneously infer the source mass distribution and $H(z)$. The source mass distribution displays a peak around $34 M_{\odot}$, followed by a drop-off. Assuming this mass scale does not evolve with the redshift results in a $H(z)$ measurement, yielding (68\% credible interval) when combined with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. This represents an improvement of 17\% with respect to the H0 estimate from GWTC-1. The second method associates each GW event with its probable host galaxy in the catalog GLADE+, statistically marginalizing over the redshifts of each event's potential hosts. Assuming a fixed BBH population, we estimate a value of with the galaxy catalog method, an improvement of 42\% with respect to our GWTC-1 result and 20\% with respect to recent H0 studies using GWTC-2 events. However, we show that this result is strongly impacted by assumptions about the BBH source mass distribution; the only event which is not strongly impacted by such assumptions (and is thus informative about $H_0$) is the well-localized event GW190814.},

We benchmark this model against other state-of-the-art waveforms in terms of efficiency and accuracy. We find a speed-up of one to two orders of magnitude compared to the underlying time-domain eob model for the total mass range $2 - 100 M_{\odot}$. More specifically, for a low total-mass system, such as a binary neutron star with equal masses of $1.4 M_{\odot}$, like GW170817, the computational speedup is around 100 times; for an event with total mass $∼40 M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $∼3$, like GW190412, the speedup is by a factor of $∼20$, while for a binary system of comparable masses and total mass of $∼70 M_{\odot}$, like GW150914, it is by a factor of $∼10$. We demonstrate that the new model is extremely faithful to the underlying eob model with unfaithfulness less than 0.01% across the entire applicable region of parameter space. Finally, we present successful applications of this new waveform model to parameter estimation studies and tests of general relativity.},

A convenient decomposition for the correlation matrix is introduced, enabling it to be calculated for all possible gravitational wave polarizations and compared to the redshift correlations from the pulsar-timing literature; in the case of a GR background of transverse traceless gravitational waves, this also allows us to identify an astrometric analog of the famous Hellings-Downs curve.

    title = "{Transition of EMRIs through resonance: corrections to higher order in the on-resonance flux modification}",
    abstract = {Extreme mass ratio in-spirals (EMRIs) are candidate events for gravitational wave detection in the millihertz range (by detectors like LISA and eLISA). These events involve a stellar-mass black hole, or a similar compact object, descending in the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole, eventually merging with it. Properties of the in-spiralling trajectory away from resonance are well known and have been studied extensively, however little is known about the behaviour of these binary systems at resonance, when the radial and lateral frequencies of the orbit become commensurate. We describe the two existing models, the instantaneous frequency approach used by Gair, Bender, and Yunes, and the standard two timescales approach implemented by Flanagan and Hinderer. In both cases, the exact treatment depends on the modelling of the gravitational self-force, which is currently not available. We extend the results in Gair, Bender and Yunes to higher order in the on-resonance flux modification, and argue that the instantaneous frequency approach is also a valid treatment of the resonance problem. The non-linear differential equations which arise in treating resonances are interesting from a mathematical view point. We present our algorithm for perturbative solutions and the results to third order in the infinitesimal parameter, and discuss the scope of this approach.},
