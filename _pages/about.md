Brief bio
======

My name is Deyan Mihaylov and I am currently a NASA ADP postdoctoral fellow at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. My current research focuses on the application of gravitational wave astronomy to Cosmology, and in particular to studies of cosmic topology. Before coming to Case Western, I was a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany, where I worked on the development of new Effective-One Body gravitational waveform models (known as pySEOBNR). Even before that I was a PhD student at the Institute of Astronomy at University of Cambridge in the UK, where I investigated the prospects of detecting gravitational waves using catalogues of astrometric data (like the one from the Gaia mission). These pages serve as a resume of my work: you can find more about my academic career here, or you can go read about my publications here. The talks I have given (or will be giving soon) are listed here, and you can get in touch with me by using one of these channels.
